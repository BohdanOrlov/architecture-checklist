# ☑️ Designing iOS architecture: Checklist

List of questions one should ask while designing an architecture.

The article explaining the motivation is [here](https://medium.com/@borlov/e984e4ebba4a).

#### 📈Is it scalable?
- [ ] Does it handle changing business requirements efficiently?
- [ ] Does it support gradual adoption in existing projects?
- [ ] Does it allow replacing third-party components easily?
- [ ] Does is encourage composition of small independent components?
- [ ] Does it allow adding UI to features later?
- [ ] Does it support breaking of retain cycles on integration rather than component level?
- [ ] Does it support people working simultaneously on different parts of a feature?
- [ ] Does it limit the use of event/notification systems to specific layers?
- [ ] Does it provide a strategy for cutting corners and tech debt?
    
#### 🚧Is it maintainable?
- [ ] Does it provide a tactic for fighting massive objects?
